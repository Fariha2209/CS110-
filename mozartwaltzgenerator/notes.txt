Program Name: generatewaltz.py

Goal: 

Approach:

The first thing the program does is read the data from the file name data.txt which contains audio 
The data file is used to create two 2D arrays called minuetMeasures (11 x 16) and trioMeasures (6 x 16)
For the column identified as j in minuetMeasures, i used stdrandom to generate two dice rolls as d1 and d2
For the column identified as j in trioMeasures, i used stdrandom to generate one dice rolls d1
The program outputs 32 values, 16 from minuetMeasures and 16 from trioMeasures

Issues & Resolution:

The first issue i had was when i tried it kept generating 272 which was an error
I resolved that by separating by loops instead of nested loops, i think due to the nesting i may have caused a problem in the loop 

The second issue i encountered was a concatenation erroe, i missed a bracket in my stdio.writeln line which led to that error.
I resolved it by adding the missing bracket.


Program Name: playwaltz.py

Goal: The goal is to play a walts generated by generwaltz.py

Approach:

Reads all the values from standard input using stdio.readAllInts()
Checks the first 16 values to check if they are within the range
Checks the last 16 values to check if they are within the range
Creates the filename of the audio files by data/Mnumber for measures
Creates the filename of the audio files by data/Tnumber for trioMeasures
Plays the audio using stdaudio.playFile()

Issues & Resolution: 

In my first attempt i encountered some issues with the range as i wrote incorrect range values.
I resolved it by reassigning the correct range values.
